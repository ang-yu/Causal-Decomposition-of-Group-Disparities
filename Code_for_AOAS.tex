\begin{abstract}
We propose a new non-parametric method for decomposing the causal effect of a variable on group disparities. Our main contribution is to separate neatly the roles of between-group and within-group effect heterogeneity in explaining group disparities, revealing a new lever for disparity reduction. Starting from an observed disparity, our decomposition contains four terms: (1) the \emph{baseline} disparity in outcomes if nobody were to receive the treatment; (2) the disparity due to the differential \emph{prevalence} of the treatment across groups; (3) the disparity due to the differential average \emph{effect} of the treatment across groups; and (4) the disparity due to the differential allocation of the treatment to individuals who benefit more or less from the treatment within groups. Our decomposition is a model-free causal generalization of the classic Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition, unites prior approaches in the social sciences and epidemiology, and resolves conceptual difficulties of recent randomized-interventional decompositions. We propose various estimators to flexibly estimate the decomposition. We apply our framework to the causal role of education in intergenerational income mobility.
